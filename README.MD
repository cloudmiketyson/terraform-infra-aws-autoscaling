AWS AutoScaling Infrastructure with Terraform

Overview

This repository contains Terraform code to set up an AutoScaling infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS). With this infrastructure, you can automatically scale your compute resources based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency for your applications.

Features

Provisioning of AutoScaling Groups to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load.
Configuration of Launch Templates to define the specifications for the EC2 instances launched by the AutoScaling Group.

Setup of Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic among the EC2 instances.
Integration with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and scaling based on custom metrics and alarms.
Management of security groups and IAM roles to ensure secure access and permissions within the infrastructure.
Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform code, ensure that you have:

An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
Installed Terraform on your local machine.
AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials.

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-autoscaling-terraform.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd aws-autoscaling-terraform

Initialize Terraform and download the required plugins:


terraform init

Modify the variables.tf file to customize the configuration according to your requirements.
Review and validate the Terraform execution plan:

terraform plan

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the AutoScaling infrastructure:

terraform apply

Once the resources are provisioned, you can access the AWS Management Console to monitor and manage your AutoScaling Groups, EC2 instances, ELB, and other associated resources.
